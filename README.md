## Overview
An advice generator application using API

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process
first, i created a html file and, then styled it with css before adding some interactions using Vanilla JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I was able to fetch an API for the first time and i really glad i did this project.
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  its so amazing what one can acheive using that
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I am not yet familiar with the use of Js. There is still so much to learn but i will keep developing myself.
